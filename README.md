- **Project Overview**:
  - The project aims to develop a comprehensive system for identifying and classifying invasive plant species using a combination of image classification models and Bayesian inference. By integrating data from various sources, including plant images and geographic information, the system seeks to improve our understanding of species distribution patterns and facilitate more effective management strategies for invasive species.

- **Dataset Description**:
  - The dataset comprises thousands of hobbyist photographs of plants, obtained from platforms like iNaturalist. Each observation includes attributes such as observed date, time, user information, data quality, licensing, location, and taxonomic information, providing valuable insights into species occurrences and environmental conditions.

- **Image Preprocessing and Geographic Data Integration**:
  - Preprocessing involves resizing and normalizing plant images to facilitate feature extraction. Geographic data, including latitude, longitude, and positional accuracy, are incorporated to enable spatial analysis and mapping of species occurrences.

- **Deep Learning Model Architecture**:
  - The chosen deep learning model architecture for plant species classification utilizes techniques such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from images. These features are then combined with other environmental variables and species occurrence records for Bayesian inference.

- **Contributions to the Project**:
  - My contributions to the project include model development, experimentation, and evaluation. This involves selecting appropriate model architectures, preprocessing image and geographic data, training the models, and assessing their performance.

- **Classification Results and Insights**:
  - The classification results demonstrate the system's ability to accurately identify and classify invasive plant species. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall are used to evaluate model performance. Spatial insights derived from the analysis provide valuable information for understanding species distribution patterns and informing management strategies.
